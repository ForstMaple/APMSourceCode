external users set goals and communicate often about your progress toward them contribute to the ongoing improvement of the engineering organization and our software what were looking for a problem solver at heart much of our work revolves around problems that have no existing offtheshelf solution or consensus on best practices. you'll often need to break down large problems into smaller more manageable tasks and utilize critical thinking to come up with novel ideas. 3+ years of engineering experience things move quickly in the data group. youll need to be comfortable and familiar with delivering highly scalable cloud based applications. professional experience with frameworks like hadoop, spark, or similar this will be a significant component of your responsibilities. you will be working with large data sets in a distributed environment on a daily basis. familiarity w/ the hadoop/spark ecosystem is a must. professional experience with python data tools our data team uses pyspark and jupyter notebooks extensively. familiarity with these technologies will also serve you well. direct experience with relational and nosql databases technologies we use the best tool for the job around here. when it comes to storing and accessing data, we recognize that the technology decisions we make directly impact our ability to provide a performant customer experience, and our own costs. experience designing and building json based restful apis because we are building our application with a front end framework, we carefully design and document the apis to power it. to help us, we follow the json api spec, but any experience in building a restful api will be useful. remember, the api is your contract with the consumers of your data! understanding of monolithic and microservice based architectures izeax still has some legacy monolithic characteristics. we move more and more of our technology to a distributed set of services, there are new challenges to overcome. understanding the differences between these two models will help you take those challenges head on. basic linux skills in order to develop our data pipelines and services, you need to run it on your laptop. this means opening up some terminal windows, running some commands, and keeping the log output open. additionally, some of our technology stack is better accessed through clis. examples include the ember cli, the rails cli/console, docker commands, gradle, and our own clis. we'll walk you through it, but you should be comfy in a terminal. ability to multitask and prioritize multiple incoming requests izea's engineering team strives to provide a great experience and great service to our users. in order to do that, you may need to context switch into a support issue or drop what you are doing to start work on something else. this is part of what agile means to us. excellent verbal and written communications skills regular and timely communication is the key to a trust based development process. you should be able to simply and concisely ask for feedback and direction in terms that your audience understands, and relay requested information in a timely fashion to your leaders. you should prioritize documentation of processes and code. demonstrated experience with the following will be highly valued data science background while not required, a fundamental understanding of statistics and modeling would be a great asset. practical experience with machine learning and/or complex data pipelines would also be welcome. front end development experience from time to time you may need to build visualization, or (lite) user facing experiences. familiarity with modern web frameworks like angular, react, ember, or vue would be helpful. extra bonus points if you have familiarity w/ javascript based visualization libraries like d3.js or highcharts. amazon web services, or other cloud providers izea's software is hosted on aws, and you will need to acquire some familiarity with it. previous experience in using a cloud provider, even if just for developer tooling, shows that you understand some of the nuances involved in working in the cloud. familiarity with amazons emr would also be an asset. continuous integration & deployment izea needs to get features and fixes out to customers as soon as we possibly can with as much confidence as possible. to facilitate this, we have developed a ci/cd pipeline (using 3rd party services). an understanding of what ci/cd is will help you understand how this pipeline works and how to make it even better. github all of izea's code is source controlled on github. we leverage github pull requests for code reviews, github integrations manage parts of our ci/cd pipeline, and github releases define the code tags that ultimately get deployed. much of our process documentation exists on github pages. familiarity with navigating github's features will help you ramp up in our sdlc faster. jira izea uses jira to manage projects and report on progress to stakeholders inside and outside the company. while we strive to automate as much of jira as possible with bots, webhooks and reports, understanding how
